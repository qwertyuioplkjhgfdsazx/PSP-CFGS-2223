# Exercises

1. Create a project called `ProcessListPNG` with a program that asks the user to introduce a path (for instance, `/myfolder/photos`), and then launches a process that prints a list of all PNG images found in this path. Try to do it recursively (either with a command from the operating system or with your own script).

2. Create a Java program called ReadName.java that receives a name from the main() arguments and displays it on the screen. It uses System.exit(1) for a correct termination of the program and System.exit(-1) in case the correct arguments were not entered in main().

   Next, create a program similar to the following:


   ```java
   /*

   package UD01;
   
   import java.io.*;

    */
   public class Test {
   
       public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
           //create File Object where the example is located
           File folder = new File(".\\bin");
           //process to execute
           ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("java", "example");
           //move to that folder
           pb.directory(folder);
           System.out.format("Working folder: %s%n", pb.directory());
           //run the process
           Process p = pb.start();
           //get the output of the process
           try {
               InputStream is = p.getInputStream();
               int c;
               while ((c = is.read()) != -1) {
                   System.out.println((char) c);
               }
               is.close();
           } catch (Exception e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   
   ```

  to execute ReadName.java. It uses the waitFor() method to check the output value of the running process. It tests the execution of the program giving value to the arguments of main() and without giving it value. What does waitFor() return in one case and in another?


3. Create a project called `ProcessKillNotepad` with a program that launches the notepad or any similar text editor from your operating system. Then, the program will wait 10 seconds for the subprocess to finish and, after that period, it will be destroyed. To sleep 10 seconds, use this instruction:

   ```java
    Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
   ```

4. Create a project called `DishWasher`. We are going to simulate a dish washing process at home, when someone wash the dishes and someone else dries them. Create the following classes:

   - A `Dish` class with just an integer attribute: the dish number (to identify the different dishes).

   - A `DishPile` class that will store up to 5 dishes. It will have a wash method that will put a dish in the pile (if there is space available), and a dry method that will take a dish from the pile (if there is any). Maybe you will need a Dish parameter in wash method, to add a dish to the pile.

   - A `Washer` thread that will receive a number N as a parameter, and a `DishPile` object. In its run method, it will put (wash) N dishes in the pile, with a pause of 50ms between each dish.

   - A `Dryer` thread that will receive a number N as a parameter, and a `DishPile` object. In its run method, it will take out (dry) N dishes from the pile, with a pause of 100 ms between each dish.

   - The `main` class will create the `DishPile`  object, and a thread of each type (`Washer`  and `Dryer`). They will have to wash/dry 20 dishes coordinately, so that the output must be something like this:

     ```sh
     Washed dish #1, total in pile: 1
     Drying dish #1, total in pile: 0
     Washed dish #2, total in pile: 1
     Drying dish #2, total in pile: 0
     Washed dish #3, total in pile: 1
     Washed dish #4, total in pile: 2
     Drying dish #4, total in pile: 1
     Washed dish #5, total in pile: 2
     Washed dish #6, total in pile: 3
     Drying dish #6, total in pile: 2
     Washed dish #7, total in pile: 3
     ...
     ```

# Activities

1. The objective of this activity is to understand the problem that concurrent programming poses when protection methods are not applied on critical sections.

   We have a system that controls the coins that enter the parking meters every hour to control the time of day with the most traffic in the parking lot.

   To do this the parking meters have two processes running in their system:

   - A counter process, which will count the coins that enter the parking meter.
   - Another process that every hour sends the number of coins to the central and sets the number of coins to zero.

   There is a shared variable that will have the number of coins in the parking meter. They are two processes that run concurrently, so it is possible that at a given moment they run at the same time.

   It indicates the possible orders of execution of instructions 1, 2 and 3 of the two processes if they are executed concurrently. Also indicate which of the possible orders would be correct.

   1.  `sendHeadOffice(currency)`
   2. `currency=0`
   3. `currency=currency+1`

   The code for the processes would be as follows:

   ```java
   void enviaNumeroModenes(){ 
     while (true){
    	enviarOficinaCentral(moneda)
    	moneda=0
    	}
    	   }
      void comptadorModenes(){ 
     	while (entradaModena==true)
     		moneda=moneda+1
        }
      }
    }
   ```
2. Say whether the following statements are true (T) or false (F):

   | No | Question | V| F |
   | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----| ---- |
   | 1 | A process always has a state | | |
